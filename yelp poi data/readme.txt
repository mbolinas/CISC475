The python file, "auto_csv.py", generates a csv file containing all the coordinates and location.
This python file "poi.py", would add the numeric value (price) for each restaurant. In the yelp database, it was represented by $ symbols. I convert it to numeric form. 1 means cheapest and 5 means most expensive.


Run the code sample by specifying the optional arguments: python poi.py --term="dinner" --location="San Francisco, CA"
